The application offers basic timer functionality allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer.

Timer logic is implemented using React Hooks (useState and useEffect) within the useTimer custom hook, promoting code reusability.

Timer value is displayed in seconds, updating every second to reflect elapsed time.

Users can interact with the timer using intuitive buttons.

Start Timer: Initiates timer countdown.

Stop Timer: Pauses the timer.

Reset Timer: Sets the timer back to zero and stops it.
